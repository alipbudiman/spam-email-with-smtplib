spam email with smtplib with Gmail

setting your gmail first.

We are using Google's Gmail service to send mail. So we need some settings (if required) for google's security purposes. If those settings are not set up, then the following code may not work, if the google doesnot support the access from third-party app.

To allow the access, we need to set 'Less Secure App Access' settings in the google account. If the two step verification is on, we cannot use the less secure access.

To complete this setup, go to the Google's Admin Console, and search for the Less Secure App setup.
